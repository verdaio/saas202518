# Project Brief Directory

This directory contains your project vision, ideas, and initial planning thoughts.

## How It Works

**Claude will automatically read ALL `.md` files in this directory** when you start planning.

Add as many files as you want - Claude will read them all and use the context when:
- Creating roadmaps
- Writing PRDs
- Planning sprints
- Making technical decisions
- Answering questions about your project

## What to Put Here

**Anything related to your project vision:**

- `brief.md` - Main project brief (already exists)
- `vision.md` - Long-term vision statement
- `target-users.md` - User personas and target audience
- `competitive-analysis.md` - Competitor research
- `mvp-scope.md` - MVP feature list
- `brand-notes.md` - Brand voice, positioning
- `technical-constraints.md` - Technical requirements or limitations
- `business-model.md` - Revenue model, pricing strategy
- `your-custom-file.md` - Anything else!

**Just create new `.md` files and Claude will read them automatically.**

## Example Structure

```
project-brief/
├── README.md                    # This file (won't be read by Claude)
├── brief.md                     # Main brief
├── vision.md                    # Vision statement
├── target-users.md              # User personas
├── competitive-analysis.md      # Competition notes
├── mvp-features.md              # MVP scope
└── meeting-notes-2024-11-02.md  # Any notes you want to keep
```

## Tips

**✅ DO:**
- Add as many files as you need
- Use descriptive file names
- Update files as your vision evolves
- Paste raw notes from meetings or brainstorms

**❌ DON'T:**
- Put code here (use appropriate project directories)
- Put sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Worry about perfect formatting - Claude understands rough notes

## When Claude Reads These Files

**Automatically during:**
1. First-time project setup ("help me get started")
2. Creating roadmaps and PRDs
3. Planning sprints
4. Any time you ask about project direction

**You don't need to tell Claude to read them - it happens automatically!**

## Format

Files should be:
- Markdown (`.md`) format
- UTF-8 encoding
- Any structure you want (bullet points, paragraphs, tables, etc.)

Claude is smart - it will understand:
- Rough notes
- Bullet lists
- Full prose
- Tables
- Mixed formats

## Need Ideas?

**Not sure what to write?** Just open Claude and say:

> "Help me fill out my project brief"

Claude will ask questions and help you create the files.

**Remember:** Everything in this directory helps Claude understand your vision better!
